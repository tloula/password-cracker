# MD5 Password Cracker

Given a set of password hashes and a wordlist, the password cracker creates various permutations of the words, hashes the permutation, compares it with the hashed passwords, and saves a list of cracked passwords. I successfully cracked all 20 of our professor's hashes - a feat very few students achieve.
