# MD5 Password Cracker

Given a set of password hashes and a wordlist, the password cracker creates various mangled versions of the words, hashes the mangled words, compares them with the hashed passwords, and saves a list of cracked passwords. I successfully cracked all 20 of the professor's hashes - a feat very few students achieve.
